ros-indigo-mongodb-store-msgs (0.0.2-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Changed collections type to StringList to allow for datacentre comms to task schduler.
  * Change action definition to use duration into the past.
  * Working and tested dump and restore with time bounds.
  * Added dump and restore.
  * Adds a service to delete message by ID
  * Adds a service to delete message by ID
  * Proof of concept working with C++ BSON library.
  * Working update method on the python side. Will not work in C++ yet.
  * Removed unused MongoQueryID.srv
  * Added update message type.
  * Message store queries now return meta as well as message.
    This is only in the python client for now, but is simple to add to C++. This could be inefficient, so in the future potentially add non-meta options.
  * Now using json.dumps and loads to do better queries from python. C++ is still a pain though.
  * Query now returns the messages asked for
  * Query structure in place
  * Meta stuff working on the way in. Starting to think about querying.
  * Added meta information as a list of string pairs
  * Working across languages with return value now.
  * Working from the C++ end, but this invalidates the Python again.
  * Basic idea works python to python
  * Service code runs (not working though)
  * Adding an insert service and the start of a message store to provide it.
