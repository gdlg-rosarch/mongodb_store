ros-indigo-mongodb-log (0.0.2-1saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Dynamically choose MongoDB API
    Use Connection if using an older mongopy, otherwise use MongoClient.
  * Cleaned up boilerplate in mongodb_log package.xml
    Removed a bunch of XML comments (that came from the package.xml
    template) from the package.xml file. Added pymongo as a run dependency.
  * Main process no longer calls init_node.
    This fixes bugs related to calling init_node multiple times in the same
    process. Main process now has its own signal handler for shutting down
    cleanly.
  * Added 'inserted_at' meta with proper date object to logged data.
    This added compatibility with message store and also allows native date queries on results.
  * Changes to how meta info is stored.
  * Added boost filesystem for new version of ld.
  * Added mongo dependency
  * More benchmark removal
  * REmoved rrd bits.
  * Removing benchmarking stuff.
  * Restructuring for new repo position.
  * Moved all files into mongodb_log subdirectory for later inclusion in a broader package.
  * Contributors: Alex Bencz, Christian Dondrup, Nick Hawes
